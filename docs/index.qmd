## Features

This template combines three of the most lightweight and performant open-source web development frameworks into a customizable webapp template with:

- Pure Python backend
- Low-Javascript frontend
- Powerful, easy-to-manage database layer

The template also includes full-featured secure auth with:

- Token-based authentication
- Password recovery flow
- Role-based access control system

## Design Philosophy

The design philosophy of the template is to prefer low-level, best-in-class open-source frameworks that offer flexibility, scalability, and performance without vendor-lock-in. You'll find the template amazingly easy not only to understand and customize, but also to deploy to any major cloud hosting platform.
