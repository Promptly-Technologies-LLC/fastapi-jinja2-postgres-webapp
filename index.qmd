---

![Screenshot of homepage](docs/static/Screenshot.png)

## Quickstart

This quickstart guide provides a high-level overview. See the full documentation for comprehensive information on [features](https://promptlytechnologies.com/fastapi-jinja2-postgres-webapp/index.html), [installation](https://promptlytechnologies.com/fastapi-jinja2-postgres-webapp/docs/installation.html), [architecture](https://promptlytechnologies.com/fastapi-jinja2-postgres-webapp/docs/architecture.html), [conventions, code style, and customization](https://promptlytechnologies.com/fastapi-jinja2-postgres-webapp/docs/customization.html), [deployment to cloud platforms](https://promptlytechnologies.com/fastapi-jinja2-postgres-webapp/docs/deployment.html), and [contributing](https://promptlytechnologies.com/fastapi-jinja2-postgres-webapp/docs/contributing.html).

## Features

This template combines three of the most lightweight and performant open-source web development frameworks into a customizable webapp template with:

- Pure Python backend
- Minimal-Javascript frontend
- Powerful, easy-to-manage database

The template also includes full-featured secure auth with:

- Token-based authentication
- Password recovery flow
- Role-based access control system

## Design Philosophy

The design philosophy of the template is to prefer low-level, best-in-class open-source frameworks that offer flexibility, scalability, and performance without vendor-lock-in. You'll find the template amazingly easy not only to understand and customize, but also to deploy to any major cloud hosting platform.

## Tech Stack

**Core frameworks:**

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/): scalable, high-performance, type-annotated Python web backend framework
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/): the world's most advanced open-source database engine
- [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/): frontend HTML templating engine
- [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/): easy-to-use Python ORM

**Additional technologies:**

- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): Python dependency manager
- [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/): testing framework
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/): development containerization
- [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions): CI/CD pipeline
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/): simple documentation website renderer
- [MyPy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): static type checker for Python
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/): HTML/CSS styler
- [Resend](https://resend.com/): zero- or low-cost email service used for password recovery

## Installation

For comprehensive installation instructions, see the [installation page](https://promptlytechnologies.com/fastapi-jinja2-postgres-webapp/docs/installation.html).

### Python and Docker

- [Python 3.12 or higher](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Docker and Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### PostgreSQL headers

For Ubuntu/Debian:

``` bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-dev libpq-dev
```

For macOS:

``` bash
brew install postgresql
```

For Windows:

- No installation required

### Python dependencies

1.  Install Poetry

``` bash
pipx install poetry
```

2.  Install project dependencies

``` bash
poetry install
```

3.  Activate shell

``` bash
poetry shell
```

(Note: You will need to activate the shell every time you open a new terminal session. Alternatively, you can use the `poetry run` prefix before other commands to run them without activating the shell.)

### Set environment variables

Copy .env.example to .env with `cp .env.example .env`.

Generate a 256 bit secret key with `openssl rand -base64 32` and paste it into the .env file.

Set your desired database name, username, and password in the .env file.

To use password recovery, register a [Resend](https://resend.com/) account, verify a domain, get an API key, and paste the API key into the .env file.

### Start development database

To start the development database, run the following command in your terminal from the root directory:

``` bash
docker compose up -d
```

### Run the development server

Make sure the development database is running and tables and default permissions/roles are created first.

``` bash
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Navigate to http://localhost:8000/

### Lint types with mypy

``` bash
mypy .
```

## Developing with LLMs

In line with the [llms.txt standard](https://llmstxt.org/), we have exposed the full Markdown-formatted project documentation as a [single text file](https://promptlytechnologies.com/docs/static/llms.txt) to make it more usable by LLM agents.

``` {python}
#| echo: false
#| include: false
import re
from pathlib import Path


def extract_file_paths(quarto_yml_path):
    """
    Extract href paths from _quarto.yml file.
    Returns a list of .qmd file paths.
    """
    with open(quarto_yml_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Find all href entries that point to .qmd files
    pattern = r'^\s*-\s*href:\s*(.*?\.qmd)\s*$'
    matches = re.findall(pattern, content, re.MULTILINE)
    return matches


def process_qmd_content(file_path):
    """
    Process a .qmd file by converting YAML frontmatter to markdown heading.
    Returns the processed content as a string.
    """
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
        content = f.read()

    # Replace YAML frontmatter with markdown heading
    pattern = r'^---\s*\ntitle:\s*"([^"]+)"\s*\n---'
    processed_content = re.sub(pattern, r'# \1', content)
    return processed_content


# Get the current working directory
base_dir = Path.cwd()
quarto_yml_path = base_dir / '_quarto.yml'

# Extract file paths from _quarto.yml
qmd_files = extract_file_paths(quarto_yml_path)

# Process each .qmd file and collect contents
processed_contents = []
for qmd_file in qmd_files:
    file_path = base_dir / qmd_file
    if file_path.exists():
        processed_content = process_qmd_content(file_path)
        processed_contents.append(processed_content)

# Concatenate all contents with double newline separator
final_content = '\n\n'.join(processed_contents)

# Ensure the output directory exists
output_dir = base_dir / 'docs' / 'static'
output_dir.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

# Write the concatenated content to the output file
output_path = output_dir / 'llms.txt'
with open(output_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(final_content)
```
