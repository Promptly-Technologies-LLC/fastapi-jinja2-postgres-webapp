## Contributors

Fork the repository, create a new branch, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

### Render the documentation

The README and documentation website are rendered with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/). Make changes to the `.qmd` files in the root folder and the `docs` folder. Then run the following commands to render:

``` bash
# To render the documentation website
quarto render
# To render the README
quarto render index.qmd --output-dir . --output README.md --to gfm
```

Due to a quirk of Quarto, an unnecessary `index.html` file is created in the root folder when the README is rendered. This file can be safely deleted.

## Maintainers
